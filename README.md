=================
This is a project for http://nobodyfuckthatguy.com.

The idea is to create a public, (optionally) anonymous way to publish some egregious offenders who should not be fucked, by anybody. Included should be some kind of name, mugshot, and a list of one's misgivings. The inspiration is Officer Robert Roche of the Oakland Police Department (bad person). He will always have a reserved spot at the top of the page.

This is an open source project. I figure rails will be a good framework. Feel free to chip in, I'll probably progress slowly on this myself.
