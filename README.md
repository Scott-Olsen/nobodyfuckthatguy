=================
This is a project for http://nobodyfuckthatguy.com.

The idea is to create a public, (optionally) anonymous way to publish some egregious offenders who should not be fucked, by anybody. The inspiration is Officer Robert Roche of the Oakland Police Department (bad person).

This is an open source project. I figure rails will be a good framework. Feel free to chip in, I'll probably progress slowly on this myself.
